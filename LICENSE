PyMessage is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3 and is also available under
alternative licenses negotiated directly with Web Heroes Inc. If you obtained PyMessage under the
GPL, then the GPL applies to all PyMessage modules used on your system as well, except as defined
below. The GPL (version 3) is included in this source tree in the file COPYING.

Web Heroes Inc. holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses to all components of the PyMessage
package, and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability for companies, individuals, or
organizations to create proprietary or Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may use at
runtime the portions of PyMessage which fall under our copyright/license umbrella, or are
distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.

If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry -- there is no requirement that you
provide the same exception in your GPL'd products (although if you've written a module for PyMessage
we would strongly encourage you to make the same exception that we do).
